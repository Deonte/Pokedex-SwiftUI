# Pokedex-SwiftUI

## Description

This application utilizes a local database used to display a list view of Pokemon. The app is designed using the master-detail concept; each cell when tapped triggers the detailView. Once inside the detail view, the user is then able to favorite the Pokemon; which then displays a list of the users favorites in the favorite tab. Created utilizing the MVVM design pattern, SwiftUI, and implemented dark mode.
